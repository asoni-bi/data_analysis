#Below we are defining the ANOVA model
#AVGEXP_YPD is a dependent variable and others are independent
#TATA box is a specific DNA sequence found in the promoter region 
#of many genes in archaea and eukaryotes
#binding site for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other transcription factors
#plays a crucial role in initiating transcription
#TATAbox in data is 1 or 0 presence/absence of a TATA box in the gene's promoter

summary.aov(model)
#Higher Sum Sq → Greater contribution of TATAbox to explaining gene expression
#Higher Sum sq for Num_RegTF_YeastractYT: means this variable has more 
#"explanatory power" in the context of the model
#Higher Mean Sq for TATAbox or NumTF: more variance in expression 
#is explained on average by that variable. It is used to calculate the F-value
#Fvalue = Mean Sq of predictor / Mean Sq of residuals
#(Mean Sq of Predictor here refers to Mean sq of TATAbox or Num_TF)
#Higher F-value → Stronger evidence that the predictor explains 
#significant variation in AVGEXP_YPD
#Pr(>F) or P-value:probability that you'd see an F-value this large (or larger)
#just by chance, if the predictor had no real effect. 
#A small p-value (e.g., < 0.05) means it's unlikely that the observed variation 
#in AVGEXP_YPD is due to chance → the predictor significantly affects gene expression.
#Num_RegTF explains more variation in AVGEXP_YPD as SumSq and MeanSq > TATAbox
#Both predictors are statistically significant (very low p-values)
#TATAbox has a real, but smaller, influence on gene expression
#Some variation is due to residuals and is therefore unexplained
